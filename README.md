# Recursivegame

The game is controlled with the numerical keys 1-5. Each key makes one of the boxes
jump. The lowest numerical key controls the outermost box, the second lowest controls
the second outermost box and so forth. Each time a box outgrows the main window all keys
 shift which box they control. The task of the game is to jump over obstacles
coming in from the right edge of the containing frame.
